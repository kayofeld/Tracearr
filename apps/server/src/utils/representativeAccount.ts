/**
 * Deterministic representative-account ordering for identity-level aggregation.
 *
 * When stats are rolled up by identity (users.id) instead of by server account
 * (server_users.id), one account has to be picked to represent the person for
 * navigation, avatar, and username fallback. This is the same preference order
 * as routes/users/list.ts's DISTINCT ON: an active, Plex-linked, most-active
 * account wins over a removed or less-active one.
 *
 * `alias` is the server_users table alias in the query (e.g. 'su2'), correlated
 * against a `users` row aliased `u` in the same statement.
